## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
ChatHistoryManager (Singleton)
├── UserChatMemory (Map<userId, memory>)
├── ChatSession[] (Array of sessions per user)
├── ChatMessage[] (Array of messages per session)
└── Learning System (Bad response patterns)
```

### Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Uses existing `useAuthStore` hook
- **UI Components**: Integrates with existing design system
- **Build System**: Works with existing build pipeline
